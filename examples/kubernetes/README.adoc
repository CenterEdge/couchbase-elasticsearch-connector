= Running the Couchbase Elasticsearch Connector in Kubernetes

== Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster (minikube is fine)

== Quickstart

1. Update `elasticsearch-connector-configuration.yaml` with your configuration.
If using secure connections, add `truststore.jks` to the ConfigMap as a binary file with the certificates to be trusted.
2. Update `elasticsearch-connector.yaml` with your resource limits.
3. `kubectl apply -f .`

== Group Name

Each instance of the Elasticsearch connector MUST have a unique group name,
otherwise the instances will interfere with each other.

This group name is used to persist state information so the stream may resume gracefully.
To change the group name, search for "example-group" in `elasticsearch-connector.yaml`.
This name must be changed at each location it appears.
